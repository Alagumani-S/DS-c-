DATE : 

PROGRAM STATEMENT :

To Write a CPP Program to insert five character elements in to Stack ADT (use STL for Stack.

ALGORITHM:  

1.	Start the program.
2.	Initialize a stack of characters named mystack.
3.	Read an integer n as the size of the stack.
4.	Print the size of the stack.
5.	Use a loop to read n characters and push each character onto the stack.
6.	Use a loop to pop and print each character from the stack until the stack is empty.
7.	End the program.

PROGRAM:

#include<iostream> 
#include<stack> 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
stack<char>mystack; 
int n,i;
char c; 
cin>>n;
cout<<"Size of the stack: "<<n<<endl; 
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
cin>>c; 
mystack.push(c);
}
while(!mystack.empty())
{ cout<<mystack.top()<<" ";
mystack.pop();
}
}



OUTPUT :

Size of the stack: 5
e d c b a


RESULT :

Thus, the C++ program to insert five character elements in to Stack ADT is created successfully.
