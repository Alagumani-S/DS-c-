EX.NO : 4(B)                  C++ COMPOSITION VS. INHERITANCE

PROGRAM STATEMENT :

To write a CPP program to demonstrate on the object composition (use character data).

ALGORITHM:  

1.	Start the program.
2.	Define a class A that has a character variable and a constructor to initialize it, along with a method to display its value.
3.	Define a class B that contains an object of class A and uses an initializer list to initialize it through B's constructor. Include a display method to show the value of A's object.
4.	In the main function, read a character input, create an object of class B with this input, and call the displaâ€™y method.
5.	End the program.

PROGRAM:

#include <iostream> 
#include <string>
using namespace std;


class A 
{
char a; // Member variable to storethestring

public:
 A(char str)
{
a = str;
cout << "Constructor A(char a) is invoked" << endl;
}

void display()
{
cout << "Data in memberobject of class A in class B = " << a << endl;
}
};

 class B {
A objA; // Object of class A as amember of class B

public:
 B(charstr):objA(str) // Usinginitializer list to initialize objA
{
cout << "Data in object ofclass B = " << str << endl;
}

void display()
{
objA.display();
}
};

 int main()
{
char input;
cin >> input;

B objB(input); // Create an object of class B with the input string 
objB.display(); // Displaydata in objBand its composed object objA

return 0;
}

OUTPUT :

Constructor A(char a) is invoked
Data in object ofclass B = R
Data in memberobject of class A in class B = R


RESULT :

Thus, the C++ program to demonstrate on the object composition is created successfully.
