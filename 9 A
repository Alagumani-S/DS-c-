EX.NO : 9(A)              B TREE
DATE : 

PROGRAM STATEMENT:

To write the findMin module of the B tree in CPP.

ALGORITHM:  

1.	Start the program.
2.	Define the function findMin: Accept the root node (myNode) of a B-Tree as input.
3.	Traverse the Leftmost Path: Initialize a pointer curr to the root node and traverse down the leftmost child (link[0]) until reaching a leaf node (i.e., a node where link[0] is NULL).
4.	Print Minimum Value: Once the leftmost node is found, print its second value (val[1]), which is the minimum value in the node's key array.
5.	End the function.
6.	End the program.

PROGRAM:

void findMin(BTreeNode*myNode)
{ 
BTreeNode *curr = myNode; 
while(curr->link[0]!=NULL)
{
curr =curr->link[0];
}
cout<<endl<<"Min="<<curr->val[1];

}




OUTPUT :


1  2  5  25  45
Min = 1






RESULT:

Thus, the C++ program to write the findMin module of the B tree in CPP is created successfully.
