EX.NO : 9(D)                SPLAY TREE
DATE : 

PROGRAM STATEMENT:

To write the right rotate module of splay tree in CPP.

ALGORITHM:  

1.	Start the program.
2.	Define rightRotate function: It takes a node x as input.
3.	Set y as the left child of x: Assign y = x->left.
4.	Reassign the left child of x: Set x->left = y->right.
5.	Update the right child of y: Set y->right = x.
6.	Return y: The new root after the rotation is y

PROGRAM:


node *rightRotate(struct node *x)
{
node*y=x->left; 
x->left=y->right;
y->right=x; return y;

}
